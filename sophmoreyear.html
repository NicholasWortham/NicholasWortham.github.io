			<p>In sophmore year we took our first website development class. This website right here is everything shakespeare, it is a website made for the sophmore english teacher here at Southwest. Everyone in class was given information and we all had to use our skills to make a website for him. This is the first website i've ever completed and was one of the biggest projects from sophmore year.</p>

		<p>This picture is from our spring pbl which was doing a confrence which taught 7th grade girls about technology. My group was a tech demo about robotics and it was an amazing experience putting together a demo and then showing all the girls. This is probably been the best pbl/project I have been apart of. We got to show young girls that its not just a boys club in the industry of tech and that we need all great minds to help work towards a better future.</p>

This paper was for my English 10 class, Mr. Moore who was my teacher this year was an amazing teacher and helped me become a better student and writer. All these papers are helping prepare us for our college classes ahead. We've been told we're gonna write write write! in college so why not start now. </p>

			<p>This photo is of one of the many Photoshop tutorials we did over the sophmore year. In animation we learned a lot, in this tutorial we learned how to make a ghost effect, make the coloring effecting using hue and saturation, and how to add shadows to an object. This was one of the harder tutorials we learned in animation, but Photoshop edits interest me and it was very fun. Editing in Photoshop is one of my favorite things that I've learned at Southwest.</p>
