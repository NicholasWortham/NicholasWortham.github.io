		<br>
			<p>	My name is Nick Wortham, I am a senior at Southwest CTA in the web design program. I have the skills to make websites and graphics, but my true love is doing presentations and working in groups to create different projects. I have learned a lot from my time here at Southwest from different coding languages to how to present myself in a professional manner. This is my online portfolio that will showcase some of the work I have so far. Thank you for being here and I hope you enjoy the work i've made.</p>
