		<p>During our freshman year at Southwest we took a graphics design class in this class we were assigned to make a self portrait of ourselves using Adobe Illustrator and a picture we took of ourselves. It was an interesting project because it was one of the first big projects we did in freshman year. It definetly taught me many things in Illustrator and new techniques to use when making graphic art.</p>

				<p>This paper I wrote in my freshman health class. The paper focused on the human body and being a personal trainer. This was one of the first major papers I wrote at Southwest. Looking back I've grown very much as a writer and this project was a good stepping stone to get us ready for the work we would do at Southwest. If I could go back to freshman year I would definitetly work on my writing skills more and practice grammar more. I've gotten much better thanks to all the papers we do here at Southwest.</p>

		<p>This is a cartoon we had to recreate using only Adobe Illustrator. This was one of the first times we got to chose and use our skills in Illustrator to make something. There are many things i've learned since this project, but this project gave us a good base. This was my first experince really making something just by myself with Illustrator. I had to use pen tool to make the curves and it really was one of the first projects I made and was proud of.</p>

		<p> One of the techniques we learned in graphics design one was how to draw in Illustrator using the perspective tool. This city street was made in Illustrator and it took a while to get the hang of the tool. Creating art that is in perspective is no easy task, but a great thing to learn. The graphics design classes are difficult for me as i'm not the best artist, but they teach really valuable lessons.</p>
